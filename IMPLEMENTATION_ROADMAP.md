# Zephyr Warehouse CRM Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Zephyr Warehouse CRM system, a comprehensive warehouse management system designed as a minimalist CRM with advanced inventory prediction capabilities.

## Current Status
- Updated dependencies to more secure, modern versions
- Created a theme system (src/utils/theme.ts) with color palette, typography, spacing, etc.
- Enhanced Tailwind configuration to incorporate the design system
- Upgraded the main App layout with responsive sidebar, dark/light mode, and modern navigation
- Redesigned the Dashboard component with data visualization and responsive layout
- Fixed TypeScript errors in Dashboard component related to chart.js typing
- Addressed security vulnerabilities
